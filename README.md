## The Purpose
This React application serves as the landing page of my developer portfolio. I have decided to go with the React option to give myself even more of an **exposure to React**, since React is my favourite library when it comes to building frontend applications.

## Running the App
### Requirements
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### The Frontend
1. Inside a terminal window, navigate into the the root folder of the project.
2. Install dependencies.
    - `yarn install` or `npm install`
3. Run the app.
    - `yarn start` or `npm start`
    
That's it! The app must now be running at *http://localhost:3000*, and you can load it by visiting this URL in your browser.
